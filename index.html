	<p> "Category Is..." is a transmedia project that talks about ballroom culture. The title is in reference to ball events as there are different categories that houses compete against each other to win trophies, money, and other prizes. Examples of categories are old way (which is when competitors would have to do the old style of vogue), face (where competitors display their beauty and judges vote based on teeth, skin, eyes, nose, and bone structure), and etc.

    Ballroom culture is a big part of the LGBTQ+ community, especially for African Americans and Latinx. The ballroom was a place were queer people would be able to be themselves and to express themselves at a time where they weren't accepted. Today, people are becoming more aware of the scene as TV shows and popular media explores the culture and its impact. This project explores what ballroom culture is and what is it today, along with ballroom beats, voguing, and houses.
