 	The title "The Ball" is in reference to the event where competitors battle against their rival houses for money and honor. This desktop documentary goes over what "The Ball" is and how ballroom was before compared to how it is now. The clips in this video are from the documentary Paris Is Burning, which shows the struggling of those in the scene in the 1980s, and Legendary, which is a modern day competition show where different ballroom houses face off. This shows the difference of how back then, ballroom culture was something underground and hidden as homophobia and transphobia were very big issues back then. Although those problems still exist today, people are more open, allowing for shows that respect ballroom culture and for ballroom to be honored for its impact on pop culture/media.
