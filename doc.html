 	The title "The Ball" is in reference to the event where competitors battle against their rival houses for money and honor. This desktop documentary goes over what "The Ball" is and how ballroom was before compared to how it is now. The clips in this video are from the documentary Paris is Burning, which shows the struggling of those in the scene in the 80s, and Legendary, which is a competition where different ballroom houses face off. This shows the difference of how back then, ballroom culture was something underground and hidden as homophobia and transphobia were very big issues back then. Although those problems still exist today, it is getting better and people are more open, allowing for shows that honor and respect ballroom culture.
