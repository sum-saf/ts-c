   Houses are a big part of ballroom culture. During the time of the 1970s and 80s, queer kids, more specifically queer kids of color, wouldn't get the acceptance from their family, resulting them to get kicked out. Most of these kids would be left on the streets with no where to go. This is how houses got created in the ballroom scene as these people would create their own communities that result in them giving each other the love and support they need.

      Houses are usually run by the house mothers or house fathers. They are the head of the houses and set the rules/tone of the house. Like real parental figures, they take care of the house children and take in new children as well, giving them a place they can call home. This aspect of found family is really important in ballroom culture and the LGBT+ community in general as acceptance never really came that easily, especially for queer people of color.
